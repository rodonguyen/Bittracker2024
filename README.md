# BitTracker

A trading bot utilising SuperTrend Algorithm.

At its core, the Supertrend calculates an upperbound and lower bound and use them as threshold to buy/sell. Due to the trending nature of cryptocurrency, trailing stop for orders is analysed (by me) and proved to be suitable and bring great profit (great enough to cancel out multiple lost trades).

However, it's not efficient during sideway + volatile period. Therefore, you can consider to turn the bot off for time like this.

Here is a demo screenshot of Supertrend Indicator in TradingView. `Buy` is placed at the end of red line and `Sell` is placed at the end of green line.
